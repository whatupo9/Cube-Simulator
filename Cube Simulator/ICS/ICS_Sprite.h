ICS_Sprite

	Created: ???

	Change log:

		2020-03-22
			- changed sprite anchor point from lower left to center
			- added texture coordinates
			- removed renderQuad (no longer needed)
			- flip texture vertically to match screen coordinates change (top left is the origin)

		2020-03-23
			- use ICS_Quad for texture coordinates
			- added getter for texture coordinates
			- overloaded setter for texture coordinates using ICS_Quad<double> as input

		2020-03-24
			- made render function independent of event handling (for manual or automatic rendering)
			- moved width and height getters and setters to the parent class

		2020-04-17
			- added per-pixel accuracy for mouse interaction (isMouseOver)
			- removed vertical flip and horizontal flip (same effect can be accomplished with scaling)

		2020-05-22
			- added ability to create a sprite from raw image data

		2023-01-25
			- moved function for rotating the sprite to ICS_Renderable

		2023-01-26
			- added function to calculate texture coordinates (useful for sprite sheets)

		2023-01-28
			- sprites are now initialized when they are constructed instead of after the engine is ready
			- added default constructor and a constructor which copies the dimensions of the texture
			- removed texture coordinates as animated sprites now use tilesets

		2023-05-31
			- fixed bug where sprites created with the default constructor have a width and height of 0

		2024-01-15
			- now the sprites assigned color is used when rendering a sprite without a texture (instead of magenta)

		2024-01-19
			- added a constructor to make a sprite with no texture (a colored rectangle)
			- added ability to render a greyscale version of the sprite

		2024-01-23
			- added a function to assign a texture to the sprite.
			- added a constructor which takes a texture as input.

		2024-01-23
			- added a function to remove the texture from the sprite.

		2024-01-27
			- removed moveForward function (should be in a subclass)

		2024-02-10
			- improved rendering by applying common OpenGL settings to the root node instead of each time a sprite is rendered.

		2024-03-21
			- overrode ICS_Renderable::applyTransformations so dimensions could be determined from the texture before rendering (fixed a glitch)

		2024-05-05
			- removed feature that used the texture's dimensions for the sprite (too messy for an unnecessary feature)

		2024-05-07
			- fixed bug with isMouseOver function not correctly detecting when the mouse coordinates are over a child
			- isMouseOver now requires an extra parameter to indicate whether the coordinates are in parent space or global space

		2024-05-09
			- modified isMouseOver to support anchor points that can be applied to children or not
